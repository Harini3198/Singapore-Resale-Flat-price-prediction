# Singapore-Resale-Flat-price-prediction
## Creating an ML model for Price prediction
### This project create an ML model to predict the price of the resale flats in singapore. This was done by the following steps:
#### 1. Extract data of "resale flat Prices in singapore" from data.gov.sg website.
#### 2. Convert the data into a dataframe and clean the data of any null values and check for the skewness in the data and handle it using preprocessing methods
#### 3. After preprocessing, Create ML model using any of the regression algorithm which gives better result.
#### 4. Create an streamlit application to get user input and gives predicted price value as output.

## Softwares used:
#### * VS Code
#### * Python
#### * Streamlit

## Packages to install
#### To install the below packages, open new terminal in your source code editor(I used VS Code to run my codes) and type the following pip commands

 
### * pip install pandas
#### Pandas is used to convert json or dictionary to a Dataframe
### * pip install streamlit
#### Streamlit is used to design and display data to users like a frondend or user end application
### * pip install sklearn
#### sklearn is used for preprocessing and creating Ml model using algorithms

## Conclusion
### This project is usefull for both Resale Flat buyers and sellers. Buyers can check for flat prices and can plan their finances according to that.Meanwhile sellers can get an idea about their flat's potential value and they can also compare the flats price increase from past years.
